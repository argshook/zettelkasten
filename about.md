Hello and welcome to my digital garden.

This page is an unordered archive of notes, updated whenever I see fit.\
It is not a blog and some notes might not even be finished.

Just like a real life garden, there are nice, groomed areas, but there also are some unattended corners, waiting to be improved.

All notes are markdown files and their source can be found on [github](https://github.com/argshook/zettelkasten). I'm happy to accept PRs with additions or fixes!

I enjoy taking notes. Over time I streamlined the note taking process pretty well, to the point where taking notes is very straighforward.

Wanted to share some of those notes, but there were some problems:

* figure out what to shar
* keep private and public notes separately
* actions of publishing always felt cumbersome

These few points were enough to prevent me from sharing.

What i wanted is to have ability to simply hit `save` and have the note published. No other actions at all, hit save and be done while notes automatically become available online.

This is that page. A random collection of personal notes with links between them. It's not a blog, there are no posts or a timeline.

They're not well edited, sometimes unformatted or completely unfinished.

But it's a living thing - a digital garden.

It's available on github, you're very welcome to contribute! [https://github.com/argshook/zettelkasten](https://github.com/argshook/zettelkasten)
