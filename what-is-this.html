        <p>When working with a computor, I really enjoy taking a lot of notes. Over time I streamlined the note taking process pretty well, to the point where taking notes is very straighforward.</p>
<p>For a while i had the idea to share some of those notes. But there were some problems, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>the hassle of figuring out what should be shared</li>
<li>managing private and public notes separately</li>
<li>the actions of publishing always felt cumbersome</li>
</ul>
<p>These few points made be hesitant to share my content until now!</p>
<p>What i wanted for a while is to have ability to just hit save and have the note published. No other actions at all, just write something down, hit save and it’s available online.</p>
<p>This is what this page is about - it’s my collection of notes. They’re mostly not well edited, sometimes weirdly formatted or unfinished.</p>
<p>But it’s a living thing - a digital garden - where any note can be changed or reformatted, or split into multiple and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>This is not a blog, there are no posts or a timeline. Just a collection of notes and links between them.</p>
<p>All of them are available on github, you’re very welcome to contribute! <a href="https://github.com/argshook/zettelkasten">https://github.com/argshook/zettelkasten</a></p>
