Welcome to my digital gardenâ€”an evolving space of thoughts, notes, and ideas.

Discover more about me and the purpose of this garden on the [About page](about.md).

Currently, I'm working on a text-based AI game called [Lairuna](https://lairuna.com).

Earlier helped building [Dhub](https://dhub.dev) - a collaborative WYSIWYG for `.md`/`.mdx` files.

Before that worked on [QuestDB](https://questdb.io) - the fastest open source time series database

Before QuestDB spent many years at [Wix](https://wix.com) working on products, component libraries, DevEx tools, CI systems, mentoring and more things I can't remember anymore ðŸ˜…

I'm often ðŸ’©posting on X [@argshook](https://twitter.com/argshook).

Thanks for hanging out!
